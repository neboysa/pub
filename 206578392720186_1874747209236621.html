Please ask any and all questions related to using oil paints, OPR ideas, issues you may have experienced, tools/brushes/product choices, making the palette, color choices, etc. <br><br>This is intended to be a technique discussion. Please keep it on point, not interested in historical accuracy to any real degree with this. Intent is to expand the knowledge base, help me target areas I need to better explain both here and in future books. The more you ask, the better this will be! Also, we can circle back around to the same topic in later sessions, so this won't be the only time I focus on OPR. <br>Thanks - Michael, RSP</p></div><div class="all"><div class="rsq"><div class="user">Rinaldi Studio</div><div class="txt">Hi guys -- I am all set up and ready to answer your questions.

Often asked... first up oil paints last a long time, many years, in fact, and they are a worthwhile investment. Start with a few colors in each range. For example, buy some rust tones, some greens, some tans, and black and white. It's also good to grab a few primary colors too, for blending, such as red, yellow, and blue. Brands should be any of the hobby labels (all are good, 502 Abt/AK, Wilder, AMMO), or a good art brand. Stay away from student grade products, go with higher end artist grades from those like Windsor&Newton or Gamblin (or similar in your part of the world).</div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">Thanks Michael.

And don't get too concerned on the subject matter. A green tank of any genre will use basically the same color palette. If you're doing a large number of sand or green camo tanks, buy accordingly.

I rarely use sealing coats. The oils won't react with he paint, and gloss is also way too smooth to paint over like this. It's better over a nice matte coat of paint. You want a little bite to be able to blend and streak with control. Gloss is like a slip&slide, oil just pushes around with purpose.</div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">One of the areas I feel like my finishes have improved in is sheen. Based on what Michael is saying - I actually use Semi Gloss paint almost exclusively, rarely using dead flat or super glossy finishes. Clear coating also seems to have a nasty habit of eliminating a lot of weathering layers.</div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user">Rinaldi Studio</div><div class="txt">Scott Gentry Exactly, and the main reason I avoid vanishes most days. It's incredible to me how much sealing is a thing.

Sometimes you really need that gritty dry earth effect and oils are limited ultimately in that regards. Otherwise, I've been able to replicate nearly every other product effect with oil paints. While you can definitely use whatever, I find oils to bring the most versatile range of abilities versus other chemicals/paints.</div></div></div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">As a first timer, could you use a (potentially) cheap di-cast model to experiment on before trying OPR on your beautifully assembled and painted model tank/plane/etc?

I'd study a few guys that specialize in them, I don't have any names in my head, but surely someone knows if there are masters out there working largely in oils.

It always takes many steps to finalize a section.<br><br>When you have applied a color, blended it for effect whether a streak or stain or tinting, dry it with a hair dryer. Because we have the oils on the palette, they will dry within minutes, sometimes faster. When you layer on top, you don't any thinner or very very little. The blending brushes need to be nearly dry, and the true trick with oil paints is barely any thinner. You control your opacities via how much thinner, and believe me you really want to keep it to a minimum. <br><br>I ten to go light to dark with color application, so applying a lighter orangish rust tone first, and then add darker rust or browns inside that are creating depth to this effect.</div></div></div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">Do you seal between oil layers? I always worried about the new layer taking off the previous one. And what do you use do dillute them?

Apparently, I'm pretty unique in this aspect...given how many Im asked about varnishes for sealing. <br><br>Why? As I mention above, the amount of thinner employed is low. Yes, if you flood the surface you'll have issues. Fundamentally, most modelers are using way too much thinner, or pre-thinned chemicals for weathering. Always have a paper towel on your desk, unload the brush every single time before touching the model, get in this habit. You control each color and effect by how much thinner is used, and believe me, it should be almost none at all for most effects. <br><br>If you are layering dust and grime (say like your current project), work light to dark...spread and blend the first dust layers how you want. Dry it, then add the next. I always have a hairdryer handy for this, and with the oils properly prepped on the palette, it goes quick quickly.</div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">I don't seal either and wanted to know if I'm doing it wrong. Thanks to clarify that. <br>It looks like I'm a bit heavy with the thinner. Definitely will use less on the following steps. Thanks.<br>Any tips on the thinner?

It's confusing across the borders sometimes. I tend to support hobby brands first before going to the hardware store, even if to save a buck or two.

Also, no smell is a huge bonus!!</div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">So I understand DIY store odorless thinner is fine or get some hobby specific stuff?

Guys, men, in general tend to be heavy handed at finishes, and getting this point across is going to be a focal point moving forward.

Less is almost always the way forward!</div></div></div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">Hi Mike!

You can always layer in whatever order you need to. If I'm doing dark first it's because I want it to be an older leak. It's a great point because so many modelers weather as one stage of life. Stains, leaks, splatters, etc. happen over the course of time, so layering darks and lights to illustrate this is highly effective. You can also come back and dry brush pure paint color to make the edges of the rubber look fresh, or parts of the red primer being rubbed clean and what not.

I like the concept of applying speckles throughout the weathering of a model, never just at one time. The point is that these very times spots and stains add a lot of depth to the finish, and for the most part unless a vehicle is constantly being washed all the time, paint will take a wide variety of spotting due to many factors, weather, maintenance, etc.<br><br>Colors can be both variations of the base colors, dust tones, dark grease and oil, basically a collection of base color variations, earth effects and leaking parts. You apply the speckles as needed, there is no hard or fast rule. Around wheels, anything that moves and gets hit with thrown up mud, dirt, etc.</div></div></div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">Hi Michael, I use Tamiya acrylics, is allways necesary ro mix it with clear?</div><div class="tofb"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RinaldiStudio/posts/1874747209236621?comment_id=1874787445899264">View on FB</a></div><div class="rsreplies"><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">Edgardo, I am not Mike - but I think I can help you.

This technique is much more specific and the concept is that you are painting on unique effects directly, versus a general smattering of random dots blended down with a wet brush and thinner. Two very different ideas here.<br><br>To that end, use less paint on the model. Chances are the amount applied is overwhelming the surface and then you need to keep using more and more thinner to blend and it's turning into a mess. Quantity is crucial with any weathering step, less tends to be the best path.

Going back and forth between the two to show older stains, newer dust, and then newer leaks and stains on top. Best to dry the layer off after a few sessions. Hair dryer is key, and really helps to lock the colors down. Also, the newer the layer, the less thinner should be used, for example the last stain is the most recent and most intense/opaque so use more pure paint, less thinner.</div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user">Rinaldi Studio</div><div class="txt">Dfens Sixs You could basically replicate that entirely with oils too, because the dust layer is so thin and light. Unless you needed or wanted dried mud or earth (using pigments or mud effect products), go all in with oils, I'd start with the light tones first, add some stains, dry it off, then start to layer back and forth to achieve this look.

This is specifically concerning Tamiya acrylics. What is the ideal surface finish?

I rarely ever apply or tweak for a satin or a gloss finish underneath. The smoother the paint, the harder this all becomes. One by product of this form of brushwork is that it ultimately smoothes a matte finish anyway, which gives a broad range of realistic sheens as you go. <br><br>If you're getting tide marks, use less thinner to begin with. That'll cut the issue down a lot. <br><br>If you're laying down thin layers for dust, light colors can often perform better if you wet the surface prior to (especially over a dark base color, which will prevent stains and blend better), and lastly use a hair dryer a lot. The faster the oils dry, the less tide marks appear in general.</div></div></div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">Ah sorry! This session is about OPR!

BUT... in most projects I found it a waste of time because the white will hide the majority of the work. Even if you tint and filter, the white will basically diffuse the tonal ranges you've created, unless a lot of the base color is going to be visible. It will largely depend on the final vision you have or the references you are using, most times, just do everything after the white, but if a lot of exposed paint is going to happen certainly apply some basic filters, washes, etc. prior to.

You've mentioned in the past how essential it is to keep your effects in scale.  How do you scale this down; especially in different genres?  I've had good results in 1/35 tanks but I also build 1/350 battleships and 1/1000 Sci fi.  How do I translate to those?  Using oil instead of pin washes is straightforward but I'm struggling past that in my experiments.</div><div class="tofb"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RinaldiStudio/posts/1874747209236621?comment_id=1874829239228418">View on FB</a></div><div class="rsreplies"><div class="rsq"><div class="user">Rinaldi Studio</div><div class="txt">A couple of ways will help you as you cross scales and genres. I dealt with this with SM03 because the mechs were 1/144 and 1/100. The two main processes of HS Chipping and OPR work in unison by allowing you to make the paint effects small enough, and then you apply the OPR and work around the size of the mark itself. If that makes sense, you aren't actually switching scales per say as it relates to your brushes, simply the area over which you are doing them. <br><br>It's more a trick of the eye, then say painting the actual chip in 1/350 size vs 1/35. So to do this, or get practice, I jump scales and will render a 1/72 tank to help me maintain the discipline and practice making smaller effects or less of them to keep the overall result in scale. <br><br>It will take some time and experience, but for me I'd work a few 1/1000 models over and see how it performs best, less will be key, less of everything, since the surface is very large but shrunken down so much. You'll be dealing with very large areas in tiny size, so keep pulling back, using less and less product to get some minor variations going. Stay away from heavy handed direct stuff like chipping and scratching, it would impossible to see at such sizes anyway. Stick more with general fading, light streaks, stains, and see how that goes. The higher the scale number is, the greater the challenge, and why we don't see a lot of properly weathering subjects in these scales.</div></div></div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">G’day Michael <br>You mentioned earlier to use a hairdryer between OPR layers. Understanding that this speeds up the process how much time between layers should one typically leave? Looking at the work in your TA books there seems to be several layers of dirt grime and weathering. How long does it usually take for you to complete OPR on a kit? I’m currently only on the chipping stage of a Panther A and really want to bring it to life with OPR.

Each kit is different, wheel size, quantity, size of the vehicle, etc. and it depends how efficient things are going. I’m guessing I put a solid 10+ hours on OPR alone, probably a lot more but don’t really keep track. 2-3 hrs at a time is normal for me, and probably over a couple of weeks time.</div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">Thanks Michael <br>So if I understand correctly you can pretty much keep the whole process flowing working around the model.

A tube of oil paint in the hobby or art store should be around $7-10 per. Just don't by student level quality, they tend to group by grades, and artist grades work better overall. The tubes will last years, so your money will go far. Build the color library over time, buy a few on occasion and before long you'll have a good selection.

OPR isn't a specific technique, it encompasses all of them under one overall process to finalize the surface finish. Mapping is included, and often used, same with washes, tints, filters, and so forth. The oils do all of this in every area. The concept change is a fundamental shift in how all of these steps are applied. Instead of applying mapping to the whole model in one overall step, it's applied locally along with all the other techniques needed or desired to complete a section at one time. <br><br>Mapping specifically refers to layering similar tones on top of each other but not covering the entire area, think contour map lines and how they recede back from the lower line. Same thing, but with color, the inner area become more opaque then the outer sections a result. It's great for whitewashes and burned out rusted effects in particular.</div></div><div class="rsq"><div class="user"></div><div class="txt">TY Michael this was my main Question and you explained it easily!
